## General Information
- This is a project to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a fictional home paint business.
- It displays information about using color in a home and color swatches with varying lightness, saturation, and hue.
- I undertook this project as a means of digging deeper into CSS and improving my ability to style websites with colors.


## Technologies Used
* HTML & CSS


## Project Status
Project is: _completed_.


## Room for Improvement
* Improve the visual design.


## Inspiration
- This is a challenge project on Codecademy's [Full Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/).
- In this project, most of the boilerplate code is provided, and the page is almost ready to be published.
- One only has to make various color related changes to improve the aesthetics.
